   Title = {Joint Naïve Bayes and LDA for Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis},
   Abstract = {In this paper we proposed a hierarchical generative model based on Na茂ve Bayes and LDA for unsupervised sentiment analysis at sentence level and document level of granularity simultaneously. In particular, our model called NB-LDA assumes that each sentence instead of word has a latent sentiment label, and then the sentiment label generates a series of features for the sentence independently in the Na茂ve Bayes manner. The idea of NB assumption at sentence level makes it possible that we can use advanced NLP technologies such as dependency parsing to improve the performance for unsupervised sentiment analysis. Experiment results show that the proposed NB-LDA can obtain significantly improved results for sentiment analysis comparing to other approaches.},

   Abstract = {In recent years, Weibo has greatly enriched people's life. More and more people are actively sharing information with others and expressing their opinions and feelings on Weibo. Analyzing emotion hidden in this information can benefit online marketing, branding, customer relationship management and monitoring public opinions. Sentiment analysis is to identify the emotional tendencies of the microblog messages, that is to classify users' emotions into positive, negative and neutral. This paper presents a novel model to build a Sentiment Dictionary using Word2vec tool based on our Semantic Orientation Pointwise Similarity Distance (SO-SD) model. Then we use the Emotional Dictionary to obtain the emotional tendencies of Weibo messages. Through the experiment, we validate the effectiveness of our method, by which we have performed a preliminary exploration of the sentiment analysis of Chinese Weibo in this paper.},

   Abstract = {Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing the characteristics of opinions, feelings, and emotions which are expressed in textual data. This paper presents a novel approach for generation of a lexical resource named PersianClues used for sentiment analysis in Persian language. Moreover, a novel unsupervised LDA-based sentiment analysis method called LDASA is proposed. In order to generate the PersianClues, at the first phase, an automatic translation approach is used to translate the existing English clues to Persian. Next, iterative refinement approach is used to correct the erroneous clues resulted from previous step. Then, topic-based polar sets are achieved from these clues and finally, each document is categorized into its related polarity using a classification algorithm. To evaluate this method, three resources about hotels, cell phones and digital cameras have been manually gathered from the e-shopping websites and the results of sentiment analysis on these resources are compared with a baseline named SVM-Unigrams. The experimental results demonstrate an improvement of 9% on average in polarity classification accuracy of the base system.},

Usually a Blog  page includes more than one theme. However the existing researches of multi-aspect sentiment analysis focus on the product reviews. In this paper, we propose a multi-aspect Chinese Blog  sentiment analysis method based on LDA topic model and Hownet lexicon. At first, we use a Chinese Blog  corpus to train a LDA topic model and identify the themes of this corpus. Then the LDA model which has been trained is used to segment the themes of Blog  pages with paragraphs. After that the sentiment word tagging method based on Hownet is used to calculate the sentiment orientation of every Blog  theme. So the sentiment orientation of the Blog  pages can be represented by the sentiment orientation of multi-aspect Blog  themes. The experiment results on SINA Blog  dataset show our method not only gets good topic segments, but also improves the sentiment classification performance.},

   Title = {A Novel Hybrid HDP-LDA Model for Sentiment Analysis},
   Pages = {329-336},
   Abstract = {Sentiment analysis studies the public opinions towards an entity, and it is an important research area in data mining. Recently, a lot of sentiment analysis models have been proposed, including supervised and unsupervised approaches. However, the role of supervised models has been undermined by the phenomenon of big data, and the unsupervised ones are drawing more and more attention. But, most current unsupervised methods are based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and they need to specify the number of aspects in advance, making them subjective. In addition, these methods treat factual words and opinioned words the same, and assume that one sentence contains only one aspect, all of which make the existing unsupervised methods unsatisfactory. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel hybrid Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (HDP-LDA) model. This model can automatically determine the number of aspects, distinguish factual words from opinioned words, and further effectively extracts the aspect specific sentiment words. Experiment result shows that our model can clearly capture the aspects people mentioned and the specific sentiment words they use in each aspect, improving the performance of sentiment analysis efficiently. At last, we compared our model with the influential topic models, namely, JST, AUSM and Maxine-LDA, on the online restaurant review, and found our model performs very well.},

   Abstract = {Today, people are able to express their opinions and ideas on any subject using personal blogs or a variety of social media environments. Contents shared by users with each passing day increases the data size on the web but this situation is a complication for meaningful information extraction. Therefore, sentiment analysis studies aimed at automatically obtaining meaningful information from social media content showed a significant increase in recent years. In these studies, automatically analyzing the content of messages and identifying sentiment such as positive, neutral, negative etc. are intended. In this study, a system has been proposed for analyzing sentiment of Turkish Twitter feeds. In addition, sentiment classification which is a leading problem for sentiment analysis studies has been performed using topic modeling and the effect of modeling on results are examined. The topic model has been created using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) algorithm. Experimental results obtained with different feature extraction model and classifiers. The results show that topic modeling is more successful compared to the methods used in the previous studies. Also, sentiment classification based on topic model knowledge has been found to increase sentiment analysis success by %26 compared to our previous work.},

As most traditional approaches for sentiment analysis are based on supervised learning models and need many labeled corpora as their training data which are not always easily obtained, various unsupervised models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been proposed for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic modeling framework based on LDA, called Dependency-Topic-Affects-Sentiment-LDA (DTAS) model, which drops the "bag of words" assumption and assumes that the topics of sentences in a document form a Markov chain, and the sentiment of one sentence is affected by its corresponding topic and its previous sentence's topic. We applied DTAS to reviews of books and hotels. The experiment results of sentiment classification shows that DTAS outperforms other unsupervised generative models and gets high and stable accuracy.},

   Abstract = {The sentiment mining is a fast growing topic of both academic research and commercial applications, especially with the widespread of short-text applications on the Web. A fundamental problem that confronts sentiment mining is the automatics and correctness of mined sentiment. This paper proposes an DLDA (Double Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to analyze sentiment for short-texts based on topic model. Central to DLDA is to add sentiment to topic model and consider sentiment as equal to topic, but independent of topic. DLDA is actually two methods DLDA I and its improvement DLDA II. Compared to the single topic-word LDA, the double LDA I, i.e., DLDA I designs another sentiment-word LDA. Both LDAs are independent of each other, but they combine to influence the selected words in short-texts. DLDA II is an improvement of DLDA I. It employs entropy formula to assign weights of words in the Gibbs sampling based on the ideas that words with stronger sentiment orientation should be assigned with higher weights. Experiments show that compared with other traditional topic methods, both DLDA I and II can achieve higher accuracy with less manual needs.},

Joy and Surprise are taken as a Positive polarity, whereas Anger, Fear and Sadness belong to Negative polarity in the binary classes, respectively. We evaluate the performances of category-based and dimension-based emotion prediction models on the 2,940 textual responses. In the former model, WordNet-Affect is used as a linguistic lexical resource and two dimensionality reduction techniques are evaluated: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). In the latter model, ANEW (Affective Norm for English Words), a normative database with affective terms, is employed. Despite using generic emotion categories and no syntactical analysis, NMF-based categorical model and dimensional model result in better performances above the baseline.},

   Abstract = {Determining the polarity of a sentiment-bearing expression requires more than a simple bag-of-words approach. In particular, words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity. In this paper, we view such subsentential interactions in light of  compositional semantics , and present a novel learning-based approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure. Our experiments show that (1) simple heuristics based on compositional semantics can perform better than learning-based methods that do not incorporate compositional semantics (accuracy of 89.7% vs. 89.1%), but (2) a method that integrates compositional semantics into learning performs better than all other alternatives (90.7%). We also find that "content-word negators", not widely employed in previous work, play an important role in determining expression-level polarity. Finally, in contrast to conventional wisdom, we find that expression-level classification accuracy uniformly  decreases as additional, potentially disambiguating, context is considered.},

Sentiment classification, which focuses on classify the comments into positive class and negative class according to the polarity of sentiment, is one of the studies. Machine learning-based method for sentiment classification becomes mainstream due to its outstanding performance. Most of the existing researches are centered on the extraction of lexical features and syntactic features, while the semantic relationships between words are ignored. In this paper, in order to get the semantic features, we propose a method for sentiment classification based on word2vec and SVM perf . Our research consists of two parts of work. First of all, we use word2vec to cluster the similar features for purpose of showing the capability of word2vec to capture the semantic features in selected domain and Chinese language. And then, we train and classify the comment texts using word2vec again and SVM perf . In the process, the lexicon-based and part-of-speech-based feature selection methods are respectively adopted to generate the training file. We conduct the experiments on the data set of Chinese comments on clothing products. The experimental results show the superior performance of our method in sentiment classification.},

   Abstract = {Online reviews as a new textual domain offer a unique proposition for sentiment analysis. Their short document length suggests any sentiment they contain is compact and explicit. Although supersized methods have obtained good results, a large amount of corpus should be trained beforehand. Recently, topic models have been introduced for the simultaneous analysis for sentiment in the document. However, the LDA model makes the assumption that, given the parameters the words in the document are all independent. It obviously isnt the case. The words in the document express the sentiment of the author. This paper proposes a model to solve the problem. We assume that the sentiments are related to the topic in the documents. A sentiment layer is added to the LDA model to improve it. Experimental result in the dataset demonstrates the advantage of the proposed model.},

Online social and news media has become a very popular for users to share their opinions and generate prosperous and timely information about real world events of all kinds. Several efforts were dedicated for mining opinions and sentiments automatically from natural language in social media messages, news and commercial product reviews. For this task a deep understanding of the explicit and implicit information are needed. Social media like facebook, twitter, online review websites like Amazon are popular sites where millions of users exchange their opinions and making it a valuable platform for tracking and analyzing public sentiments. This provides important information for decision making in various domains. A lot of research has been done on modeling and tracking public sentiment. Here main focus is given to interpret sentiment variations. It has been observed that emerging topics within the sentiment variation periods are greatly related to the actual reasons behind the variations.},

   Abstract = {Abstract--The advent of the Social Web has provided netizens with new tools for creating and sharing, in a time- and cost- efficient way, their contents, ideas, and opinions with virtually the millions of people connected to the World Wide Web. This huge amount of information, however, is mainly unstructured as specifically produced for human consumption and, hence, it is not directly machine-processable. In order to enable a more efficient passage from unstructured information to structured data, aspect-based opinion mining models the relations between opinion targets contained in a document and the polarity values associated with these. Because aspects are often implicit, however, spotting them and calculating their respective polarity is an extremely difficult task, which is closer to natural language understanding rather than natural language processing. To this end, Sentic LDA exploits common-sense reasoning to shift LDA clustering from a syntactic to a semantic level. Rather than look- ing at word co-occurrence frequencies, Sentic LDA leverages on the semantics associated with words and multi-word expressions to improve clustering and, hence, outperform state-of-the-art techniques for aspect extraction.},

   Abstract = {Abstract-This paper proposes a new approach to aspect-based sentiment analysis. The goal of our algorithm is to obtain a summary of the most positive and the most negative aspects of a specific product, given a collection of free-text customer reviews. Our approach starts by matching handcrafted dependency paths in individual sentences to find opinions expressed towards candidate aspects. Then, it clusters together different mentions of the same aspect by using a Word Net-based similarity measure. Finally, it computes a sentiment score for each aspect, which represents the overall emerging opinion of a group of customers towards a specific aspect of the product. Our approach does not require any seed word or domain-specific knowledge, as it only employs an off the-shelf sentiment lexicon. We discuss encouraging preliminary results in detecting and rating aspects from on- line reviews of books. We investigate the efficacy of topic model based approaches to two multi-aspect sentiment analysis tasks multi aspect sentence labeling and multi-aspect rating prediction},

The research presented investigates the differences in perception of whether feedback is positive, negative or neutral according to students and examiners. This paper also investigates the adequacy of an automated sentiment analysis engine with a view that sentiment information when combined with the feedback tag and source code may create a more informative sharable learning resource.

Results indicate that there are important differences between the sentiment of feedback perceived by students and examiners.

To address this problem, we propose to analyse feedback automatically using sentiment analysis.

To find the best model for automatic analysis we look at four aspects: preprocessing, features, machine learning techniques and the use of the neutral class. We found that the highest result for the four aspects is Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the highest level of preprocessing, unigrams and no neutral class, which gave a 95 percent accuracy.},

Twitter, being one of these new technologies, presents a uniqueenvironment where one can track sentiments expressed about various topics. This report therefore considersthe problem of attempting to classify sentiments expressed on twitter about certain products, services orpersonalities as being positive, negative or neutral. The approach adopted to solve this problem is throughthe use of machine learning methods. In particular, the Na茂ve Bayes model is chosen to build the classifier.This being a learning problem, training data and testing data is required. Two methods of collectingtraining data are considered and their impact on the performance of the classifier is discussed. The firstmethod is distant supervision, where emoticons are used as labels to identify and collect training data thatcontains sentiment information. The other method is manual supervision where a human trainer manuallyidentifies and labels training data with that contains the necessary sentiment information. It is discoveredthat using distant supervision to collect training data results in poorer performance, than using manualsupervision techniques, even where the training set collected using distant supervision is larger than thetraining set from the manual supervision techniques. Using emoticons as labels to identify 5000 tweets astraining data, the classifier performed with an accuracy of 70.3% compared to use of 500 hand labeledtweets as training data which resulted in 76.3% accuracy. A third method for collecting training data usingmanual supervision methods is also suggested and its performance is also discussed. This method whichuses hand labeled keywords grouped according to word characteristics yields a performance of 80.3%. Thisreport concludes by giving recommendations of ideal models to start with when attempting to develop atwitter based sentiment classifier.

In this review paper, we highlight the various parts to consider when creating an ensemble of machine learning classifiers for sentiment analysis. Starting from the selection of suitable text features until the training of the machine learner, they all influence the accuracy of the system. The ensemble framework improves the accuracy of the system based on the concept that stronger classifiers compensate for the performance of weak classifiers.

   Title = {Sentiment analysis on students’ real-time feedback},
   Abstract = {Previous literature identifies that students’ real-time feedback is important in the learning process. There are numerous studies that have collected students’ feedback in real time. However, they include several limitations of which the most important is analysing the feedback. In this thesis, we address these limitations by proposing a system that will automatically analyse students’ feedback in real time and present the analysis results to the lecturer. To create such a system, we propose the use of sentiment analysis.The extensive literature highlights the importance of this research in the sentiment analysis field, as there is no research exploring sentiment analysis for students’ real-time feedback and research in the educational domain has been focused mainly on e-learning. The literature shows that emotions are also important in learning and could be detected using sentiment analysis. Consequently, this research is also important as there is little research in detecting emotion from students’ feedback.Polarity detection is explored and two experiments were done to identify the best combination of preprocessing, features and machine learning techniques to create an optimal model for polarity detection of students’ feedback. As a result, we found that the optimal model was to use a lower level of preprocessing, unigrams for features and Complement Naive Bayes for the classifier.Emotion detection in students’ feedback is also explored. Two experiments were done to find the optimal model to detect emotions related to learning from students’ feedback. The results showed that models which detect a single emotion have a better performance than multiple emotion models. Three emotions (i.e. Amused, Bored, and Excited) were more easily detected than others. The optimal model to detect emotion included a low level preprocessing, unigrams as features and Complement Naive Bayes as the classifier.Sarcasm detection in students’ feedback is explored. Our results showed that the lower level of preprocessing led to the best performance. Moreover, by adding other features, such as polarity and emotions, to the unigrams, sarcasm detection increased. Lastly, the best classifier to detect sarcasm was Complement Naive Bayes.Visualisation of the sentiment analysis models results is also investigated. Six visualisations were created and evaluated by lecturers. The findings indicated that there lecturers had no strong preference for a specific visualisation.The system evaluation was performed in real-life settings. As a result, we found that the lecturers were highly satisfied with the system, while the students had a neutral towards negative view of it.},

The overall objective of our ongoing research is to work out a robust method of detecting sentiment in Polish texts by means of developing relevant polarity lexical resources. The present study attempts to illuminate the process of creating a general polarity lexicon for Polish based on outputs provided by a customised Markov Random Walk algorithm, operating on an independently built semantic network for the Polish language. The customisations include a specially developed application that allows for a collaborative evaluation of the algorithm's output so that it can be used as a newest of parameters in a subsequent iteration of experiments. The results are compared with both the findings of our previous studies as well as those reported by other researchers.},

   Abstract = {Sentiment analysis has received great attention recently due to the huge amount of user-generated information on the microblogging sites, such as Twitter [1], which are utilized for many applications like product review mining and making future predictions of events such as predicting election results. Much of the research work on sentiment analysis has been applied to the English language, but construction of resources and tools for sentiment analysis in languages other than English is a growing need since the microblog posts are not just posted in English, but in other languages as well. Work on Bangla (or Bengali language) is necessary as it is one of the most spoken languages, ranked seventh in the world [13]. In this paper, we aim to automatically extract the sentiments or opinions conveyed by users from Bangla microblog posts and then identify the overall polarity of texts as either negative or positive. We use a semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for the development of the training corpus which avoids the need for labor intensive manual annotation. For classification, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and do a comparative analysis on the performance of these two machine learning algorithms by experimenting with a combination of various sets of features. We also construct a Twitter-specific Bangla sentiment lexicon, which is utilized for the rule-based classifier and as a binary feature in the classifiers used. For our work, we choose Twitter as the microblogging site as it is one of the most popular microblogging platforms in the world.},

A limited questionnaire, regarding the most essential training questions, was mailed to all non-responders.The response rate was 60% (250) for the full questionnaire. Only 15 (6%) of the programs offered formal training in telephone management to their residents. This training usually consisted of single lectures (nine programs) or reading materials (seven programs). The respondents felt that formal training in telephone management was very important (155, 62%) and that such training should be a part of every internal medicine curriculum (150, 60%).Few internal medicine programs offered training in telephone management. When training occurred, it was usually limited and informal. Most program directors felt that training was important and that current training efforts were unsatisfactory, emphasizing the need for curriculum development and implementation in telephone management.},

   Abstract = {Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate trends in mortality due to different stroke subtypes in the population of Belgrade during the period 1989-2003. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mortality data for stroke were compiled from material of the Municipal Institute of Statistics. Stroke mortality rates were standardized by world standard population. Linear regression coefficient in time trend analysis of mortality rates was assessed by Fisher's test. RESULTS: In Belgrade, 1989-2003, the highest values of mortality rates were for ischemic stroke in both sexes: 50.1/100,000-men, and 39.9/100,000-women. The mortality rate from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was lower in men (3.9/100,000) compared to women (5.3/100,000). For intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the death rate was 3.1 times higher than that for SAH. Stroke due to hemorrhage was a more common cause of death than ischemic stroke for both sexes in all age groups up to 59. In older age, ischemic stroke became the more frequent cause of death. The time trends of stroke mortality rates in the Belgrade population during the period 1989-2003 showed that the most excessive statistically significant increase in death rates was related to ICH in both sexes. The death rates from SAH had increasing tendency in both sexes, especially in women (p=0.017). Upward trends were observed for ischemic stroke mortality rates too, with statistical significance in men (p=0.048). CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to explain the causes of the increasing burden of stroke in Serbia. Since different profiles of risk factors play a role in the etiology of different stroke subtypes, these facts should be taken into account in the creation of both prevention and management strategies.},

   Abstract = {In recent years, research in sentiment classification has received considerable attention by natural language processing researchers. Annotated sentiment corpora are the most important resources used in sentiment classification. However, since most recent research works in this field have focused on the English language, there are accordingly not enough annotated sentiment resources in other languages. Manual construction of reliable annotated sentiment corpora for a new language is a labour-intensive and time-consuming task. Projection of sentiment corpus from one language into another language is a natural solution used in cross-lingual sentiment classification. Automatic machine translation services are the most commonly tools used to directly project information from one language into another. However, since term distribution across languages may be different due to variations in linguistic terms and writing styles, cross-lingual methods cannot reach the performance of monolingual methods. In this paper, a novel learning model is proposed based on the combination of uncertainty-based active learning and semi-supervised self-training approaches to incorporate unlabelled sentiment documents from the target language in order to improve the performance of cross-lingual methods. Further, in this model, the density measures of unlabelled examples are considered in active learning part in order to avoid outlier selection. The empirical evaluation on book review datasets in three different languages shows that the proposed model can significantly improve the performance of cross-lingual sentiment classification in comparison with other existing and baseline methods.},

   Abstract = {Twitter is a microblogging platform in which users can post status messages, called 鈥渢weets,鈥 to their friends. It has provided an enormous dataset of the so-called sentiments, whose classification can take place through supervised learning. To build supervised learning models, classification algorithms require a set of representative labeled data. However, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semi-supervised learning. This type of learning uses unlabeled data to complement the information provided by the labeled data in the training process; therefore, it is particularly useful in applications including tweet sentiment analysis, where a huge quantity of unlabeled data is accessible. Semi-supervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although appealing, is relatively new. We provide a comprehensive survey of semi-supervised approaches applied to tweet classification. Such approaches consist of graph-based, wrapper-based, and topic-based methods. A comparative study of algorithms based on self-training, co-training, topic modeling, and distant supervision highlights their biases and sheds light on aspects that the practitioner should consider in real-world applications.   <!-- #ads iframe { /* float: none;*/ width: 300px; border:0px !important; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; } #ads div { display: inline; width: 300px; } #ads .bsap_adhere { display:none; }   BuySellAds Ad Code   (function(){ var bsa = document.createElement('script'); bsa.type = 'text/javascript'; bsa.async = true; bsa.src = '//s3.buysellads.com/ac/bsa.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(bsa); })();   End BuySellAds Ad Code   Advertisements     BuySellAds Zone Code    End BuySellAds Zone Code   BuySellAds Zone Code    End BuySellAds Zone Code   BuySellAds Zone Code    End BuySellAds Zone Code},

   Abstract = {Sentiment analysis from data streams is aimed at detecting authors’ attitude, emotions and opinions from texts in real-time. To reduce the labeling effort needed in the data collection phase, active learning is often applied in streaming scenarios, where a learning algorithm is allowed to select new examples to be manually labeled in order to improve the learner’s performance. Even though there are many on-line platforms which perform sentiment analysis, there is no publicly available interactive on-line platform for dynamic adaptive sentiment analysis, which would be able to handle changes in data streams and adapt its behavior over time. This paper describes ClowdFlows, a cloud-based scientific workflow platform, and its extensions enabling the analysis of data streams and active learning. Moreover, by utilizing the data and workflow sharing in ClowdFlows, the labeling of examples can be distributed through crowdsourcing. The advanced features of ClowdFlows are demonstrated on a sentiment analysis use case, using active learning with a linear Support Vector Machine for learning sentiment classification models to be applied to microblogging data streams.},

   Journal = {IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine},
   Volume = {11},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {34-44},
   Abstract = {In product reviews, it is observed that the distribution of polarity ratings over reviews written by different users or evaluated based on different products are often skewed in the real world. As such, incorporating user and product information would be helpful for the task of sentiment classification of reviews. However, existing approaches ignored the temporal nature of reviews posted by the same user or evaluated on the same product. We argue that the temporal relations of reviews might be potentially useful for learning user and product embedding and thus propose employing a sequence model to embed these temporal relations into user and product representations so as to improve the performance of document-level sentiment analysis. Specifically, we first learn a distributed representation of each review by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Then, taking these representations as pretrained vectors, we use a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units to learn distributed representations of users and products. Finally, we feed the user, product and review representations into a machine learning classifier for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on three large-scale review datasets from the IMDB and Yelp. Experimental results show that: (1) sequence modeling for the purposes of distributed user and product representation learning can improve the performance of document-level sentiment classification; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmark datasets.},

   Abstract = {Abstract Daily millions of messages appear on the web, which is becoming a rich source of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. The computational study of opinions, feelings and emotions expressed in a text often relates to the identification of agreement or disagreement with statements, contained in comments or reviews, that convey positive or negative feelings. The detection and analysis of sentiment in textual communication is a topic attracting attention also in the context of collaborative learning in social networks, being learners actively engaged in presenting and defending ideas and opinions, as well as exchanging moods about courses with peers. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of a probabilistic approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as Sentiment Grabber. Through this approach, for a set of documents belonging to a same knowledge domain, a graph, the Mixed Graph of Terms, can be automatically extracted. The paper shows how this graph contains a set of weighted word pairs, which are discriminative for sentiment classification. The proposed method has been tested in different context: a standard dataset containing movie reviews; a real-time analysis of social networks posts; a collaborative learning scenario. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed approach is effective and satisfactory.},

   Abstract = {This paper presents a new method for sentiment analysis in Facebook that, starting from messages written by users, supports: (i) to extract information about the users' sentiment polarity (positive, neutral or negative), as transmitted in the messages they write; and (ii) to model the users' usual sentiment polarity and to detect significant emotional changes. We have implemented this method in SentBuk, a Facebook application also presented in this paper. SentBuk retrieves messages written by users in Facebook and classifies them according to their polarity, showing the results to the users through an interactive interface. It also supports emotional change detection, friend's emotion finding, user classification according to their messages, and statistics, among others. The classification method implemented in SentBuk follows a hybrid approach: it combines lexical-based and machine-learning techniques. The results obtained through this approach show that it is feasible to perform sentiment analysis in Facebook with high accuracy (83.27{\%}). In the context of e-learning, it is very useful to have information about the users' sentiments available. On one hand, this information can be used by adaptive e-learning systems to support personalized learning, by considering the user's emotional state when recommending him/her the most suitable activities to be tackled at each time. On the other hand, the students' sentiments towards a course can serve as feedback for teachers, especially in the case of online learning, where face-to-face contact is less frequent. The usefulness of this work in the context of e-learning, both for teachers and for adaptive systems, is described too.},

   DOI = {10.1145/944012.944013},
   Abstract = {The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation. Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., “honest”, “intrepid”) and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., “disturbing”, “superfluous”). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This paper introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of 82.8{\%} on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95{\%} when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.},

   Abstract = {近些年来,随着web2.0技术的产生和飞速发展,尤其是诸如电子商务、博客、论坛、微博等许多新兴互联网平台的出现,越来越多的用户习惯于在这些网络平台上发表自己的观点,表达自己的感受。而随着网络用户量的不断增加,产生的用户评论数量也呈爆炸式增长,仅凭用户来翻看这些评论以获取有价值的信息,变得不切实际。因此,一个新的用来帮助用户对海量评论进行分析甄选,从中抽取出有价值的信息的研究方向应运而生,即“情感分类”。在情感分类研究中,用的最多的也最有效的方法是基于机器学习的方法。在基于机器学习方法的情感分类研究中,最重要的环节是有效特征的提取。在前人的研究中,往往只考虑了浅显的词汇特征和句法特征,而忽略了对于隐含的语义特征的提取。针对此问题,本文主要进行了以下三个方面的研究:1)本文利用word2vec可以获取语义联系的特性,首先对文本语料库进行了相似特征聚类的实验,将语料库中描述同一个产品特征的词语进行了聚类,方便后续的情感分类研究工作可以获得良好的分析总结。实验结果表明,利用word2vec可以很好地将语料库中的相似特征提取出来,并聚合为同一产品特征簇。2)本文提出了基于word2vec和SVMperf的中文文本情感分类研究方法。方法利用word2vec的特性,将文本中的词汇表示为向量空间中的高维向量,通过对这些词向量进行余弦相似度的计算,从而获得词汇之间在语义上的相似度,然后将这些向量作为语义特征,用SVMperf分类模型进行训练,得到最终的分类结果。实验结果表明,此方法可以获得较好的分类结果。3)为了进一步提升分类的正确率,本文又在上述情感分类方法的基础上,在提取特征时,考虑了否定词、程度词和转折词等上下文结构特征,再结合语义特征,一起作为有效特征用SVMperf训练和测试。实验结果表明,结合了上下文结构特征的情感分类方法可以获得更佳的分类效果。最后,本文将情感分类算法与具体应用相结合,开发了一套股票分析系统。系统主要通过对股民评论的情感指数与股票价格走势的分析对比,判断两者有无相关性。},
